              Harmony grew up in Binondo alongside a large extended family. She loves animals and seems to always gravitate towards dogs she meets. Except birds. She hates birds except when it's for dinner. She's very close to her sister, Hannah and would always involve her in most of her activities if she has her way.

              Harmony is adding to her vows that she will forever allow a room allotted to a man-cave with contents and decor subject to Roel's discretion. How time is spent in the man-cave will not be questioned.

              Born in June of 1981, Roel grew up tinkering on a 386 IBM clone personal computer. Fascinated by the machine, he went on to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. After his graduation, he went on to work as a Software Engineer and then as an IT Consultant. Working with computers is his passion, he spends his spare time writing software for himself. Aside from computers, he has recently taken up playing the guitar and owns an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, and a guitalele to date.</p>

              Roel is adding to his vows a lifetime of IT support to Harmony that he will be readily available 24/7 to troubleshoot anything and everything technical

        <h2>How We Met</h2>
        <p>
          In late 2005, Harmony and Roel met at NEC. Roel was already working there then and was teaching the new comers. He decided that this woman will have to teach him about life for a long time to come.

        <h2>The Engagement</h2>
        <p>
          On a trip to Penang in one of the rare 4-day weekend in Singapore, the pair was dead tired from exploring the city. After returning to the hotel, Roel asked Harmony if they could go to the beach just outside the hotel. Harmony wasn’t really up for it since they’ve been walking and sampling the food of Penang for the whole day but after seeing Roel’s face when she said no she decided it wouldn’t hurt to spend a few minutes by the beach. Sitting on a shed by the beach Harmony was falling asleep when Roel nudged her with a gold box in hand. He asked her if she would marry him and she giggled and cried and said yes.
